This is regression for a hadoop cluster running battlecode

# THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING RUNNING GAMES
1. For setup make sure to run chmod +x on the python files so they can be ran
2. Please be in the battlecode_beasts folder when running the command found in example
3. Please test your input using cat in the example for the mapper
4. DO NOT be Luke. DO NOT be an idiot and make these mistakes!!!

The setup right now is to use makeFiles.py to make all the bots
I plan to make a function using scp to copy the files to all the machines
The hadoop cluster will then have a basic tournament setup, much more basic than now, write now the tournament setup makes the files too so alot of code can be removed
