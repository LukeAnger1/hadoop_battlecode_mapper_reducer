This is regression for a hadoop cluster running battlecode

For setup make sure to run chmod +x on the python files so they can be ran

The setup right now is to use makeFiles.py to make all the bots
I plan to make a function using scp to copy the files to all the machines
The hadoop cluster will then have a basic tournament setup, much more basic than now, write now the tournament setup makes the files too so alot of code can be removed
